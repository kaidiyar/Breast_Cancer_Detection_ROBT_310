# Breast_Cancer_Detection_ROBT_310
This is the project, which was done during the ROBT 310 Image Processing Course by using image processing techniques and different deep learning models, such as Swin Transformer and CNN baselines. This project showed that some techniques from image processing like PARULA pseudocoloring could be helpful to get better results.
